            <p>Here's an example of my work as a data analyst! This is the finished product of one of the case studies I've completed. I started with a business problem and a large amount of raw data. I applied data storage, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis techniques, and created a simple, clear presentation to support stakeholders in making data driven decisions.</p>
            <p>This example contains a statement of business task, some graphs to illustrate my findings, a brief explanation of the graphs, my recommendations for business solutions based on my findings, and also a recommendation for what other questions might benefit from further data analysis.</p>
            <p>This analysis is based on a case study from the Google Data Analytics course. To see the code I used for entire process, including data cleaning and aggregation, please see the Bikeshare Case Study notebook on my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/loresmith">Kaggle profile.</a></p>

              <h2>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</h2>
              <h4>And how could casual riders be encouraged to buy an annual membership?</h4>

              </div>

              <p>As you can see, riders with annual memberships to Cyclistic ride more on weekdays. Presumably, they're using Cyclistic bikes to get to work. Casual riders without memberships are more likely to rent Cyclistic bikes on weekends.</p>

                </picture>
              </div>

              <p>Regardless of the day of the week, annual membership holders, on average, take much longer rides than casual riders who don't have memberships.</p>

              <p>Based on this analysis, here are my recommendations to encourage casual riders to buy memberships:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Make sure the location of our stations allows people living in different areas of the city to conveniently use Cyclistic bikes to get to work.</li>

                  <li>Tailor advertising around the benefits of biking to work.</li>

                  <li>Create a separate membership tier for weekend riders. Tailor ads for weekend riders to highlight the benefits of biking every weekend.</li>
                </ol>
              <p>It might also be useful to collect and analyze data on riders' experiences and any difficulties or frustrations they experience when using Cyclistic bikes to commute.</p>
